## [Unreleased]

## [1.3.1] - 2022-05-03
### Fixed
- Textbox: non left-aligned text rendering fixed and clear method fixed.
- CameraImpl: with new version of GStreamer, devnode can be empty. If it's the
case, fallback to /dev/video0. This is a temporary workaround.

## [1.3] - 2021-12-10
### Added
- TextBox: performance optimization for text rendering.
- i18n example uses gettext and provides a new window with runtime translation.
- AnimationSequence: addition of removeLast and removeAt methods. Now,
  AnimationSequence allows to use several times the same sub animation.

### Changed
- Default widget and font size based on the screen size instead of an arbitrary
  value.

### Fixed
- Git commit id was incorrect when EGT was built from Buildroot.


## [1.2] - 2020-06-28
### Added
- ImageLabel/ImageButton: add an option to keep the image ratio when the image
  is auto-scaled.
- Serialization/de-serialization: continue to improve the support but still
  experimental.
- The git commit id and the state of the tree used to build the library can be
  displayed:
  EGT_DEBUG=1 examples/basic/basic
      633509063 [info] EGT Git Version b1fabd9d-dirty

  end which removes the constraint start < end.
