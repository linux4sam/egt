## Todo

Priority 1
- Convert event loop and timers to asio.
- Pass parent to constructor of widgets as reference.
- More work on Painter, and seperate our paint(), fill(), stroke() calls.
- Fixup coordinate system (based on hierarchy) and come up with a logical coord. system.
- All child coordinates need to have an origin in the parent frame.

Priority 2
- Abstract out widget drawing implementation so that widget drawing can be themed.
- Move all 2D graphics drawing primitives into Painter.
- Identify a hard path to support 2D GPU under graphics primitives used.
- Backbuffer all widgets and seperate damage() from redraw(). Is this really a performance improvement?

Priority 3
- Add (zlib) compression to resources.  Likely want option to enable/disable it.
- Make resources identifiable by original name.  Current nameing scheme stinks.
- Chart widgets (kplot is nice, but lacks bar charts): pie, bar, line, point (having working prototype of kplot).
- XML loader and tool to create screens (find existing tool).
- MIME support.
- Popup widget.
- Radio widget.
- More grid options.
- Scroll wheel widget.
- File open/save.
- Scroll window.
