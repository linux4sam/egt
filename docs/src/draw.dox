 @page draw Drawing

This chapter discusses how drawing works and how rectangles are marked for
redraw.

@section draw_loop Damaging and Drawing

Each widget has a box(), which holds the bounding rectangle for the widget.
This is the rectangle a widget is responsible for at some z-order level for
what content should be placed inside that bounding box.

Widgets are organized into a tree.  At the top of the tree there is a top level
widget that is a special type of widget called a egt::Frame.  A egt::Frame
widget is a composing widget, which is just another way of saying an
egt::Frame can deal with zero or more children widgets inside of its box().

Widgets are essentially rectangles that are drawn.  The widget defines the
content of what is drawn, but all that matters to the widget is its rectangle
and its content.  That widget rectangle is directly drawn into a single global
back buffer for the screen.  This is an internal buffer in memory.  This back
buffer is continuously updated in place by redrawing damaged rectangles using
the widgets that cover it.  When all of the rectangles have been drawn in a
single iteration of the egt::EventLoop, only the damaged region of that back
buffer is then copied to a display buffer.  The display may actually have more
than one buffer in order to handle double or tripple buffering.  So, when
switching between these buffers the screen has to manage damaged regions for
each of the buffers.

This means there are two flows up and down the widget hierarchy.  One is
propogation of the damage rectangles, and the other is propogation of redrawing
the damaged rectangles with the correct content.

Damage propogates *up* in the tree.  If leaf node widget is damaged, it will
ultimately report the damage rectangle to a egt::Frame which has a surface.
This is usually the top level frame or the special plane frame.

Drawing goes the other way and is initiated by the egt::EventLoop.  The
egt::EventLoop will call on all top level frames and special plane frames to
redraw their damage regions.

@section draw_paint Painting

Typically, drawing should only be done inside the egt::Widget::draw() method.

When a widget is asked to draw, it does it by using egt::Painter.  egt::Painter
is a simple 2D primitive graphics drawing API.  egt::Painter can be used to draw
lines, and rectangles, fills, and fonts.  It even supports more complicated
features drawing like gradients and arcs.

The backend used by egt::Painter is the excellent
<a href="https://www.cairographics.org/">cairo graphics</a> library.  Which in
turn uses <a href="http://www.pixman.org/">pixman</a> for optimized pixel
manipulation.  Both cairo and pixman take advantage of hardware acceleration
when possible.

To use cairo directly in a egt::Widget::draw() method, get the cairo context by
calling egt::Painter::context() and then call cairo function like normal.

@code
auto cr = painter.context();
cairo_set_line_width(cr.get(), 1.0);
cairo_stroke(cr.get());
@endcode

When using egt::Painter to draw, there are also several other very common
properties and resources used.  For example, the palette() of the widget is
usually referenced, along with its egt::Font when applicable, an also the
use of egt::Color comes into play.
